    <h1>Gleba</h1>
    <div>
      To combat spoilage:
      <ul>
        <li>fully-grown trees are overproduced, and harvested fruit is kept only in small quantities,</li>
        <li>assembly lines are kept short in parallel biochamber groups, and</li>
        <li>excess is burned.</li>
      </ul>
      In case spoilage does happen, inserters at common failure points remove it to be burned. A small amount of excess nutrients are constantly fed to the main nutrient providers, in case their own nutrients spoil. This also allows automatic start-up for new biochamber groups. Tesla turrets are included in any biochamber group that deals with eggs.

    <div>Gleba was powered by nuclear until fusion became availble.</div>
    <div>Gleba is protected by a perimeter of Tesla turrets. When they became available, artillery were added.</div>

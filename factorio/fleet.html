    <h2>Inner Planet Tugboats</h2>
    To establish bases on the inner planets, a general-purpose tugboat was created for each. Each tugboat travels between Nauvis and its respective planet. Their main purpose is to import infrastructure to their respective planet, and export materials back to Nauvis. Secondarily, each tugboat offers extra basic asteroid crushing yields to whichever planet requests it. The Fulgopher moves slower because of the reduced solar power available above Fulgora. The Glebanought moves faster to help combat spoilage.

    <h2>Miners</h2>
    Once advanced asteroid crushing was available, two miners were created to supplement the ground production of various materials, in particular calcite and coal. Each miner traverses Nauvis to Vulcanus and back, favoring Nauvis as the hub planet, and the abundant solar power. The Calcifer's focus is on making renewable calcite available to Vulcanus and Nauvis, while the Coalhouse is focused on coal.

    </div>
    <h2>Aquilo</h2>
    The Aquilo tugboat focuses slightly less on mining than the inner planet tugboats, though it does provide ice to Aquilo to build ice platforms. Asteroids travel down the spine of the ship, then back up on the right-hand side, where extras are thrown out. The Aquarc is nuclear powered given the low solar power available above Aquilo, the extra power requirements to produce rockets, and the desire to move relatively fast to make up for the long trip to Aquilo. Gleba is visited on the way to Aquilo, and Fulgora on the way back. This saves some rocket parts compared to importing all materials from Nauvis.

    <h2>Asteroid Quality Reprocessing</h2>
    Once legendary quality was available, the special-purpose miner Qualitron was created. Asteroids are reprocessed to legendary quality, and crushed into six types of legendary raw materials. The Qualitron is fusion powered. It traverses between Nauvis and Vulcanus, like the other miners.

    <h2>Promethium Science</h2>
    The Prometheus was designed to travel beyond the solar system's edge, harvest promethium, return to Nauvis, request biter eggs and produce promethium science until promethium was used up, then head to Gleba to regroup before starting again. In early testing, it was noted that the corners of the ship were most often damaged by asteroids. Crumple zones were added on each side, allowing early detection of problems clearing asteroids. However, the original vessel was lost due to a software bug that caused it to travel infinitely far. There was not enough time after the first notification of damage to understand and fix the bug. A blueprint was created before it was lost. The Prometheus II was created and the software bug fixed. It has run smoothly since.

    </div>
    <h2>Small Couriers</h2>
    With legendary materials coming in from the Qualitron, a couple processing steps taking advantage of the lava on Vulcanus were desired. Given the slow rate at which legendary materials were produced, it was favorable to dedicate a small ship to each process.

    </div>
    <h2>Fast Couriers</h2>
    As demand for agricultural science grew, three fast couriers for spoilables were created. The Bioflux Baron sends bioflux to Nauvis, the Egbert sends biter eggs to Gleba, and the Agrinaught takes agricultural science to Nauvis.

    </div>
    <h2>Fulgora Orbital Transport</h2>
    As demand for EM science grew, a way to connect independent recycling islands without trains was desired. The Holmes was created to serve this purpose. It was built as a small courier above Nauvis, sent to Fulgora, and converted to a holmium orbital transport base.

    <h2>Nontrivial Legendary Materials</h2>
    Attempts to get to the Shattered Planet were underway, but explosives production was a bottleneck. To create a legendary cryogenic plant, legendary lithium plates were needed. Quantum processors are made from five solid materials, four of which are hard to produce in legendary quality. Additionally, they are an intermediate product, meaning productivity modules can be used to produce them. And they can also be made in an EM plant. So a quantum processor upcycler was created in orbit above Nauvis. Such a facility could also be made on Aquilo, but shipping barrels of fluoroketone was preferred to dealing with the cold.

    </div>
    <h2>Shattered Planet</h2>
    <div>
      Learning from the problems with the front corners of the Prometheus, the Madshatter was made with a rounded front. The forward-facing railguns at the far left and right deal with the most asteroids, as they are at the front of the sharpest corner. The same is true of the other gun types directly behind these two railguns.
    </div>
    <div>
      A more important lesson learned from the Prometheus, that is hard to see, was to include alerts for any problem. In particular: low ammo and low fuel.
    </div>
    <div>
      Explosive rockets were favored given the expected asteroid density.
    </div>
    <div>
      Given that this ship needed to work while in flight, it made little sense to keep a buffer of asteroids handy. So the design simply vents extra asteroids.
    </div>
    <div>
      The Madshatter was optimistically designed to run at 200 km/s, but the speed was reduced to 150 km/s when explosives yet again became a bottleneck as promethium asteroid density increased.
    </div>
    <div>
      Many minor modifications were made to the front gun layout as progress to the Shattered Planet continued. The regular guns are barely used because explosive rockets take most of their targets, and the lasers with superior range take the rest.
    </div>
    <div>
      While the front lasers prioritize small asteroids, it is important to let them shoot other asteroid types. This provides clear visual feedback about where asteroids are.
    </div>
    <div>
      Two of the asteroid collectors were set to focus on carbonics as carbonic density faltered while promethium density increased. Minor adjustments to machines, modules, inserters, and belts were made as throughput demands increased.
    </div>
    <div>
      As promethium asteroid density further increased, the skirt of lasers around the sides of the ship couldn't keep up, given that laser damage doesn't scale with asteroid density. Note that slowing down the ship creates more danger for the sides of the ship. However, turning around while regrouping will lower the asteroid density back to a tolerable level. The problems with asteroids at the sides were addressed in a few ways. First, the rear of the ship was tapered to avoid needing to deal with asteroids not threatening the thrusters. Second, laser manufacturing was added and the skirt was doubled. Finally, a pair of rocket turrets that were underused in the front section were moved a third of the way back.
    </div>
    <div>
      The Madshatter reached the Shattered Planet with no further issues. Regarding research: explosives were the most researched damage type, at +680%.
    </div>
    <div>
      The Madshatter is currently returning to Nauvis. It now also builds repair kits and conveyor belts.

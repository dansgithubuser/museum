    <h1>Vulcanus</h1>
    <div>Vulcanus avoids acid neutralization in favor of receiving ice from space platforms. It also receives and prefers to use calcite from space platforms.</div>
    <div>Vulcanus receives legendary calcite and turns it into legendary rock; and it receives legendary plastic and returns legendary LDS, copper, and steel beams.</div>
    <div>Vulcanus was powered by solar until fusion became available.</div>
    <div>Tesla turrets were used to kill demolishers, until the railgun was available.</div>
